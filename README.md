# 🏗️ Construction Website Prototype

👋 Hi, I'm **Manav**, a 17-year-old Class 12 student and a frontend developer.

This is a **non-functional prototype** of a construction company website created purely to **showcase the layout, design, and visual elements** I can build.

None of the buttons or links will work — making the full functionality would require over **10,000+ lines of code**, which feels unnecessary since this demo is only for visual presentation.

## 📸 Features

- 🖼️ Modern layout with professional feel
- 🎨 Custom styling and simple animations
- ⚠️ On-load alert message explaining the non-working state
- 📱 Responsive design for multiple screen sizes

## ⚠️ Note

> 👷‍♂️ This is **just a prototype** — all buttons and links are disabled.  
> Please view it as a sample of design skills, not a complete app.
